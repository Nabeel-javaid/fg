Below is a comprehensive execution plan divided into two phases. This plan covers all aspects from initial development through to future expansion across multiple social channels. The plan assumes you will use your existing infrastructure (Linux-based servers or Azure) and that you prefer to work with OpenAI’s API for language generation. The plan is designed to be modular and well-documented so that your in-house DevOps team can easily deploy, extend, and maintain the system.

# **Overall Project Overview**

**Objective:**  
Develop an intelligent AI agent using the ElizaOS framework that:  
- Monitors X (Twitter) for tweets related to lotteries and crypto topics.
- Generates cheerful, on-brand replies that highlight Boost Lottery’s unique selling points (USPs) by drawing on source material (whitepaper, website, industry data).
- Provides a “review” (or dry-run) mode so that responses can be previewed before posting.
- Is fully configurable for keywords, topics, training data, and sentiment.

**Key Technologies:**
- **ElizaOS Framework:** Built in TypeScript for creating, deploying, and managing autonomous AI agents.
- **APIs:**  
  - Twitter API for tweet monitoring and posting.
  - OpenAI API for natural language generation.
- **Hosting & Infrastructure:** Self-hosted on your Linux or Azure environment.
- **Version Control & Documentation:** All code and detailed setup instructions delivered via a private GitHub repository.

     - Ensure the generated reply is naturally cheerful and persuasive.
   - **Configurable Templates:**  
     - Allow for easy modifications so that additional source materials or updated USPs can be injected into the prompt.
   - **Testing:**  
     - Validate sample responses to confirm the tone and content match the project’s requirements.

4. **Review/Dry-run Functionality (Day 3–4)**
   - **Preview Mode Implementation:**  
     - Develop a feature (via a web dashboard or command-line output) that displays the generated tweet for manual review.
     - Include a toggle option (e.g., via an environment variable such as `DRY_RUN=true`) to switch between live posting and review mode.
   - **Approval Workflow:**  
     - Optionally, implement a manual approval mechanism where a user can trigger the posting after reviewing the response.
   - **Testing:**  
     - Run end-to-end tests to simulate the complete flow from tweet detection to review output.

5. **Integration, Testing, and Documentation (Day 4–5)**
   - **End-to-End Integration:**  
     - Connect the data acquisition, reply generation, and review modules into a unified workflow.
   - **Error Handling & Logging:**  
     - Implement comprehensive logging and error handling for all API interactions.
     - Ensure graceful fallback in case of API downtime or errors.
   - **Comprehensive Documentation:**  
     - Document the process for adding new source material, updating keywords, and modifying the reply template.
     - Include troubleshooting steps and best practices for system maintenance.
   - **Internal Demo:**  
     - Provide a demo or walkthrough (via video or live session) to ensure your team understands the system.

6. **Delivery & Handover (Day 5–6)**
   - **Source Code Delivery:**  
     - Finalize the codebase and share it through the private GitHub repository.
   - **Final Review & Adjustments:**  
     - Conduct a review session with your team to address any questions.
     - Make any final adjustments based on feedback.
   - **Documentation Delivery:**  
     - Provide the full documentation package (setup, configuration, training, and maintenance guides).

# **Phase 2: Enhanced Social Media Automation**

### **Goals for Phase 2:**
- Expand the system to support drafting tweets based on real-time sentiment analysis and scraping news sources.
- Automate the overall social media strategy across multiple platforms, including Twitter, Discord, and Telegram.
- Implement an intelligent marketing strategy module that suggests campaigns and content before execution.
- Maintain configurability and review/dry-run functionalities to ensure quality and on-brand communication.

### **Detailed Tasks and Timeline:**

1. **Advanced Tweet Drafting Module (Estimated 10 Hours per Platform)**
   - **Sentiment-Based Drafting:**  
     - Enhance the reply generation module to factor in real-time sentiment analysis from scraped news and social sentiment on Twitter.
     - Integrate additional data sources (news feeds, industry reports) to refine content generation.
   - **Automated Draft Creation:**  
     - Develop a module that drafts tweets automatically and stores them in a queue.
     - Include options for manual review and scheduling before posting.

2. **Multi-Platform Integration (Twitter, Discord, Telegram)**
   - **Platform Connectors:**  
     - Build connectors for Discord and Telegram in addition to Twitter.
     - Ensure that the core logic (data acquisition, content generation, and review) is abstracted so it can be reused across platforms.
